## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid for this challenge. Flexbox is used to align the main content of the page in the center of the viewport, and CSS grid is used to align the sections of the main content when viewed on desktop-sized screens. I created explicit columns for the desktop layout, but I used implicit rows instead so they would be automatically sized to fit their content. Using implicit rows also allowed me to use less code. 

### Accessibility Note

The colors originally specified in the style guide for this challenge did not meet the minimum contrast requirements for WCAG AA compliance. Having sufficient contrast is important for users with low vision and/or color blindness to ensure they are able to read the information. Therefore, I adjusted the colors to meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.
